### Physical Fitness Assessment Initiative (Aggregated Fitness Assessment Data)

Fitness data for more than two million Texas students is available to view in aggregate form. The data posted is aggregated by district, grade, and gender beginning with the 2007-2008 school year. Preliminary fitness data for 2013-2014 is posted below. This data represents only those districts and charter schools that submitted data via the PFAI application. The availability of the full report of all data submitted via PFAI and FITNESSGRAM 10 will be determined at a later date. All identifying information has been removed to protect student privacy. Aggregates with less than five total students are masked. Data is only available for the districts that submitted information. This information does not include scores, economically disadvantaged indicators, attendance, or disciplinary data.
